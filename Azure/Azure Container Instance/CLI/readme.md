Welcome at this guide for setting up a LTO node within Azure. This is a quick-setup of a secure LTO node by using the Azure CLI and only executing a few commands!

The container we will be creating is called an Azure Container Instance. Azure will take care of the fact it should be running always. We have the possibility to create an LTO with or without an API public accessible. 

Use the topics above to choose between the different nodes to setup. 

Happy staking!
